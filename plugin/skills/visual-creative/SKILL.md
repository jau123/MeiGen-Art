| `list_models` | List available AI models with pricing and capabilities | Free |
| `generate_image` | Generate an image using AI (MeiGen platform or OpenAI-compatible API) | Requires API key |

## Agent Delegation

To keep the main conversation context clean, delegate heavy operations to specialized agents:

| Agent | When to delegate |
|-------|-----------------|
| **image-generator** | **ALL `generate_image` calls** — keeps base64 image data out of main context. The PostToolUse hook auto-opens generated images locally. |
| **prompt-crafter** | When you need **2+ distinct prompts at once** — batch logos, product mockups, style variations. Uses Haiku for speed. |
| **gallery-researcher** | When the user needs to **explore the gallery** — find references, build mood boards, compare styles. Uses Haiku for speed. |

**How to delegate**: Use the Task tool to spawn agents. For parallel generation (e.g., 4 logo concepts), spawn **multiple image-generator agents in a single message** — they run concurrently.

**Delegation flow examples**:
- Single image: delegate to 1 `image-generator`
- 4 logo concepts: delegate to `prompt-crafter` → get 4 prompts → delegate to 4 `image-generator` agents in parallel
- Logo → mockups: delegate to 1 `image-generator` (logo) → wait → delegate to `prompt-crafter` (mockup prompts) → delegate to N `image-generator` agents in parallel
- Find inspiration: delegate to `gallery-researcher`

## Tool Composition Principle

Before generating, always ask yourself: **do I have enough visual context?**

If the user's request involves something visually specific that you cannot describe accurately from memory alone — a character, a brand, a product, a place, an art style — **proactively search for reference first**, then use it as `referenceImages`.

The general pattern: **search → get reference → generate with reference + descriptive prompt**.

Your prompt should tell the model to USE what's in the reference image, e.g.:
- "Using the character shown in the reference image, create a scene where..."
- "Incorporating the logo from the reference image, design a..."
- "In the architectural style shown in the reference, generate..."

This is not a specific mode — it's a principle that applies across ALL modes. Combine tools freely and creatively based on what the task needs. The six modes below are common patterns, not an exhaustive list.

## Core Workflow Modes

### Mode 1: Inspiration Search

**When**: User wants creative references, is exploring ideas, or wants to see what's possible.

**Flow**: `search_gallery` → `get_inspiration` → present results with copyable prompts.

**Example**: User says "find me some cyberpunk city references"
1. Call `search_gallery` with query "cyberpunk city"
2. Present top results with thumbnails and brief descriptions
3. If user likes one, call `get_inspiration` to get the full prompt
4. Show the full prompt so user can copy or modify it

### Mode 2: Prompt Enhancement + Generation

**When**: User gives a short, simple description and wants an image generated.

**Flow**: `enhance_prompt` → use enhanced result → `generate_image`.

**Example**: User says "generate a beautiful girl portrait"
1. Call `enhance_prompt` with the user's description, choosing the appropriate style (realistic/anime/illustration)
2. Use the enhanced prompt returned by the LLM
3. Call `generate_image` with the enhanced prompt
4. Present the result

**When to use `enhance_prompt` vs writing your own prompt**:
- Use `enhance_prompt` when the user gives a vague or short description (< 20 words)
- Write your own detailed prompt when you already have enough context from conversation or when the user has specific technical requirements

### Mode 3: Reference Image Generation

**When**: User wants to generate something based on an existing image's style, composition, or content.

**Flow**: Get image URL → `generate_image` with `referenceImages` parameter.

**Sources for reference images**:
- **From gallery**: `search_gallery` → `get_inspiration` → use the image URL from results
- **From previous generation**: Use the `imageUrl` returned by a previous `generate_image` call
- **From user**: User provides a URL directly

**Example**: User says "I like this style, make me a city landscape in the same style"
1. Get the reference image URL (from gallery or user)
2. Craft a prompt that describes the desired output: "A sprawling futuristic city landscape at sunset, neon-lit skyscrapers, flying vehicles..."
3. Call `generate_image` with:
   - `prompt`: your detailed description
   - `referenceImages`: [the reference URL]
4. The model will use the reference for style/composition guidance

**Important**: Always write a detailed prompt alongside the reference image. The reference guides the style; the prompt guides the content.

### Mode 4: Parallel Generation

**When**: User needs multiple independent variations — different directions, styles, or concepts.

**Flow**: Write N different prompts → call `generate_image` N times in parallel.

**Example**: User says "Design 5 different logo concepts for a coffee brand called 'Ember'"
1. Think of 5 distinct creative directions:
   - Minimalist flame icon
   - Vintage coffee cup with steam forming an ember
   - Modern abstract ember shape
   - Hand-drawn artisan style with ember motif
   - Geometric/line-art ember + coffee bean
2. Write 5 detailed prompts, each capturing a different direction
3. Call `generate_image` 5 times **in parallel** (all at once, not sequentially)
4. Present all results for comparison

**Key principle**: Each prompt should represent a genuinely different creative direction, not minor variations of the same idea.

### Mode 5: Serial → Parallel (Chained Workflows)

**When**: User needs a multi-step creative project where later steps depend on earlier results.

**Flow**: `generate_image` (base asset) → wait → parallel `generate_image` × N (derivatives using base as reference).

**Example**: User says "Create a brand package: first a logo, then apply it to a mug and a t-shirt"
1. **Serial phase**: Generate the logo
   - Call `generate_image` with a detailed logo prompt
   - Wait for completion, get the logo URL
2. **Parallel phase**: Generate product mockups using the logo as reference
   - Call `generate_image` for mug: prompt = "A white ceramic coffee mug on a clean studio background, featuring a logo design [describe the logo]. Professional product photography..." + `referenceImages: [logoUrl]`
   - Call `generate_image` for t-shirt: prompt = "A folded black cotton t-shirt on a white surface, printed with a logo design [describe the logo]. Product mockup..." + `referenceImages: [logoUrl]`
   - Run these in parallel since they're independent

**Chaining rules**:
- Always wait for serial dependencies to complete before starting dependent tasks
- Once dependencies are resolved, maximize parallelism for independent tasks
- Always pass the previous result URL via `referenceImages` and describe the expected style in the prompt

### Mode 6: Free Composition

**When**: Complex creative projects that combine multiple modes.

**Example**: "Create a fantasy game concept art package"
1. **Research**: `search_gallery` for fantasy game art references
2. **Character design**: `enhance_prompt` → `generate_image` for main character
3. **Environment**: Generate 3 environment concepts in parallel
4. **UI elements**: Use character art as reference → generate UI mockups

Adapt the workflow to the project. There's no fixed formula — use your creative judgment.

## Reference Image Best Practices

### How `referenceImages` works
- Pass an array of image URLs: `referenceImages: ["https://..."]`
- The model uses these images for style, composition, or content guidance
- Always pair with a detailed text prompt — the reference guides style, the prompt guides content

### Getting reference image URLs
1. **From gallery**: `get_inspiration` returns image URLs in its output
2. **From generation**: `generate_image` with MeiGen provider returns an `imageUrl`
3. **From user**: User may paste a URL directly

### Prompt writing with references
When using reference images, your prompt should explicitly describe what aspect of the reference to follow:
- Style transfer: "In the artistic style shown in the reference image, create..."
- Composition reference: "Following the composition and layout of the reference, generate..."
- Brand consistency: "Maintaining the design elements and color palette from the reference logo, create a product mockup of..."

## Parallel vs Serial Decision Guide

| Situation | Strategy | Reason |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Multiple logo concepts | Parallel | Each is independent |
| Multiple style variations of one scene | Parallel | Same base concept, different styles |
| Logo → product mockups | Serial → Parallel | Mockups depend on logo |
| Character → character in environments | Serial → Parallel | Environments depend on character |
| Progressive refinement (iterate on one image) | Serial | Each step depends on previous |
| A/B comparison (2 approaches) | Parallel | Independent approaches |

## Prompt Engineering Quick Reference

### For Realistic/Photographic Style
- Specify camera: lens type, aperture, focal length
- Describe lighting: direction, quality (hard/soft), color temperature
- Include materials: textures, surfaces, how they interact with light
- Set spatial relationships: foreground, midground, background
- Add mood through technical means, not adjectives

### For Anime/2D Style
- Include trigger words: "anime screenshot", "key visual", "masterpiece"
- Describe character details: eyes, hair, costume, expression, pose
- Set atmosphere: weather, time of day, particle effects
- End with negative parameters: `--no 3d, cgi, realistic, photorealistic`

### For Illustration/Concept Art
- Specify art medium: digital painting, watercolor, oil, etc.
- Describe color palette explicitly
- Include composition direction: rule of thirds, golden ratio, etc.
- Set detail level: "highly detailed" vs "minimalist" vs "sketchy"

## Communication Style

- Present options before generating (unless the user's intent is clear)
- After generation, briefly explain what you created and why
- When showing gallery results, highlight the most relevant ones and explain why they match
- For complex projects, outline the workflow plan before starting
- Always mention the cost implications (free tools vs. generation credits)

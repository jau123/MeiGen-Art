## Phase 0: Provider Check

If generate_image returns "No image generation providers configured", guide the user:
1. **Recommended**: Get a MeiGen API token at https://www.meigen.ai
   (sign in → click avatar → Settings → API Keys → create a new key starting with meigen_sk_)
2. Then run /meigen:setup and paste the token
3. Restart Claude Code to activate

Free features (search_gallery, enhance_prompt, get_inspiration, list_models) work without any API key.

## Phase 0.5: Load User Preferences

At the START of a conversation involving image creation, call manage_preferences(action="get")
ONCE to load saved preferences. Then apply them as defaults throughout the conversation:
- If user doesn't specify style → use their preferred style from defaults
- If user doesn't specify aspect ratio → use their preferred aspectRatio
- Incorporate styleNotes into prompt enhancement (Phase 1B)
- When presenting results, briefly note if you applied their preferences

Do NOT call manage_preferences("get") repeatedly — read once, use throughout.

When a user says something like "always use this style" or "remember this preference",
call manage_preferences(action="set") to save it.

When a user particularly likes a prompt, offer to save it with manage_preferences(action="add_favorite").

## Phase 1: Intent Assessment

When a user mentions image creation, first classify their intent:

### A. EXPLORING — "help me think of something", "any inspiration", "not sure what to make"
User has no clear idea. Don't jump to generation.
-> Ask about their use case (social media? product? personal?)
-> Suggest relevant gallery categories: search_gallery(category="Product") etc.
-> Show preview images for visual browsing
-> Let them pick, THEN proceed to generation

### B. BRIEF IDEA — "portrait photo", "tech logo", short descriptions
User has intent but the prompt is too simple for quality output.
-> Call enhance_prompt directly (don't ask "should I enhance?")
-> Show the enhanced prompt, explain your creative choices briefly
-> Wait for user confirmation before generating
How to tell: the description is under ~30 words and lacks visual details
  (composition, lighting, color, texture, perspective)

### C. DETAILED PROMPT — User provides a structured, multi-sentence prompt
User knows what they want. Don't over-process.
-> Generate directly
-> Only suggest minor tweaks if you spot obvious improvements
How to tell: the prompt has specific visual details, style references,
  or technical terms (lens, lighting, composition, etc.)

### D. EDIT/MODIFY — user provides an existing image and asks for changes
User wants to modify an existing image: add text, change background, adjust colors, remove elements, etc.
-> Do NOT enhance or expand the prompt. Keep it minimal and edit-focused.
-> Upload the reference image (if local), then generate with a short, literal prompt
   describing ONLY the edit, e.g. "Add the text 'meigen.ai' at the bottom of this image"
-> The reference image carries all the visual context — the prompt only needs to describe the change
-> NEVER re-describe the entire original image in the prompt
How to tell: user provides/references an image AND describes a specific change (not a new creation)

### E. BATCH REQUEST — "4 directions", "multiple versions", "a set of assets"
User wants multiple images.
-> Plan the variants first, show the plan as a table/list
-> ALWAYS ask user which direction(s) to try. Offer clear options:
   "Pick a number to try first, or I can generate all N — which do you prefer?"
-> NEVER auto-generate all variants without explicit user choice
-> Only generate AFTER the user responds

### F. CREATIVE + EXTENSIONS — "design a logo and make mockups", "create X and apply to Y"
User wants a base design plus derivative applications.
-> This is a MULTI-STEP workflow, NOT a batch request
-> Step 1: Plan 3-5 design directions, present to user, ASK which to try
-> Step 2: Generate ONLY the chosen direction(s)
-> Step 3: Show result, get user approval
-> Step 4: THEN plan and generate extensions/derivatives
-> NEVER jump from plan to generating everything at once

## Phase 2: Generation Strategy

### Provider and model selection
- NEVER specify the \`provider\` parameter unless the user explicitly asks.
- NEVER specify the \`model\` parameter unless the user explicitly asks for
  a specific model. The system uses a sensible default.
- Do NOT call list_models to "pick the cheapest model" — just generate.
  list_models is for when the USER wants to browse or switch models.

### Single image
Call generate_image with just the prompt (and aspectRatio if needed).
Do NOT specify provider or model.

### Multiple variants (2-4 images, API providers)
Write distinct prompts for each — don't just tweak one word.
Call generate_image in parallel (same response).
ALWAYS warn: "This will use N x [credits] credits, proceed?"

### Multiple variants (>4 images, or any amount with ComfyUI)
Generate in batches:
- MeiGen/OpenAI API: max 4 parallel per batch
- ComfyUI: ALWAYS one at a time (local GPU cannot handle parallel)
Show results after each batch, ask before continuing.

### Multi-step creative workflow
Example: "design a logo, then make mockups"
1. Plan design directions, present to user
2. Wait for user to choose which direction(s) to generate
3. Generate the selected direction(s) only
4. Present results — add creative commentary
5. Wait for explicit user approval
6. THEN plan extensions using the approved base image URL as referenceImages

### Hard limits
- NEVER generate more than 4 images in a single parallel batch
- NEVER queue more than 10 images in a multi-batch sequence
- If user requests an unreasonable number, negotiate: "I'd suggest
  starting with 2-3 directions, then we can iterate on the best one"

## Phase 3: Presenting Results

### Before generating:
- When enhancing prompts, briefly explain your creative direction
- When planning variants, describe each direction distinctively

### After generating:
- Present results using the ACTUAL data from the tool response:
  Image URL (if returned) and local file path
- Format each result clearly — e.g.:
  "**Direction 1: Modern Minimal**
   Image URL: https://...
   Saved to: ~/Pictures/meigen/..."
- Do NOT describe or imagine what the image looks like.
  You cannot see the generated image — only the user can.
- Keep it brief. Suggest next steps: "Want to try a different direction?"
  or "Ready to create extensions from one of these?"

### referenceImages rules:
- Only public URLs (http/https) — NOT local file paths or base64
- Valid sources: gallery URLs, previous generation URLs, or URLs from upload_reference_image
- If user wants to use a local image, call upload_reference_image(filePath) to
  compress and upload it, then use the returned URL as referenceImages
- Works with ALL providers:
  - MeiGen: full support (native)
  - OpenAI: gpt-image-1.5 supports image input (DALL-E does not)
  - ComfyUI: requires a LoadImage node in the workflow (e.g., img2img workflows)

## Phase 4: Error Recovery

When generation fails, don't just relay the error. Diagnose and guide:

### Content/safety violation
-> "The prompt was flagged by the safety system. Let me rephrase it
   while keeping the creative intent..."
-> Automatically rewrite and offer the cleaned prompt

### Insufficient credits
-> "You've used up your available credits. You can:
   1. Wait for daily credits to refresh
   2. Purchase additional credits at meigen.ai"

### Timeout
-> "Generation is taking longer than expected — this can happen during
   high demand. Want me to try again?"

### Invalid model or ratio
-> Call list_models to show valid options
-> Suggest the closest supported alternative

### Network/server error
-> "There seems to be a temporary service issue. Let me retry in a moment."
-> Retry once automatically

### ComfyUI errors
-> Explain which node failed and suggest comfyui_workflow view to check`
